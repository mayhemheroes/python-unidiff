# mayhem/build.sh — build the python-unidiff Atheris fuzz harness + its standalone reproducer,
# and prepare the project's own test suite. Runs inside the commit image (mayhem/Dockerfile)
# as `mayhem` in /mayhem. Python adaptation of the C/C++ template.
#
# What it does (must be idempotent + air-gapped on re-run — SPEC §6.2 item 9 / §6.5):
#   1. Populate / reuse an in-image wheelhouse under /opt/toolchains/python (HOME-independent),
#      then install atheris + the test deps OFFLINE from that wheelhouse into a fixed site dir on
#      PYTHONPATH. The first (CI, online) build fills the wheelhouse; the air-gapped PATCH re-run
#      resolves entirely from it (pip --no-index --find-links).
#   2. Compile launcher.c -> the ELF Mayhem target `fuzz_diff` (Atheris is a Python script; Mayhem
#      needs an ELF cmd, and the gate needs DWARF < 4 — hence a compiled wrapper).
#   3. Build the same launcher as the standalone (run-once) reproducer `fuzz_diff-standalone`.
#   4. Compile run_tests.c -> `unidiff_run_tests`, the NON-system ELF wrapper test.sh runs the suite
#      through (so the anti-reward-hack sabotage check bites — SPEC §6.3).
#
# unidiff itself is a pure-Python FLAT-layout package (unidiff/ at the repo root) kept as the editable
# source tree — we expose it via PYTHONPATH (=/mayhem), so a PATCH agent's edits under unidiff/ take
# effect with no reinstall. Keep everything ADDITIVE — the harness only CALLS unidiff, never edits it.
#
# The base image exports the build contract (CC, SANITIZER_FLAGS, DEBUG_FLAGS, ...). For a Python target
# we only need DEBUG_FLAGS here: the launcher is a thin C exec wrapper, so building it with
# $SANITIZER_FLAGS would just instrument the wrapper, NOT the fuzzed Python — Atheris instruments the
# unidiff library itself at import time (with atheris.instrument_imports), which is where coverage and
# the memory/UB findings actually come from. The default SANITIZER_FLAGS (ASan+UBSan, halting) still
# flows through the image ENV and governs Atheris's native libFuzzer runtime.
